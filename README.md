# Pokedex-app

![Preview-screen](https://github.com/Wesleyfbarretos/Pokedex-app/blob/main/images/app.png)

## About this Project

The idea of the App is:

_"A beautiful and cozy pokedex to learn more about your favorite pokemons"_

This is a full stack project, from database operation to the API linked to the frontend, if you want to use only the backend and database to build your own project, feel free. I have a documentation explaining it separately [here](https://github.com/Wesleyfbarretos/backend-DEX).

## Functionalities

- You can search for pokemons by type and name, or both together.
- If you no longer want to filter by type or name, you can reset it by clicking the "Reset" button.
- Want to see more pokemons ? Just scroll down.
- By clicking on the pokedex glass ball, the search menu will open, if you click again it will close.
- When you pass the mouse over the cards, they rotate and show another part of the card.
- By clicking on one of the cards, you are redirected to a page that shows the shiny version of the same pokemon you clicked on, and there you can continue browsing and see more shiny versions.

## Why

This project is one of the parts of my personal portfolio, so,  I'll be happy if you could provide me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me a better developer!

## Some Observations about this App

1 - The data used to populate the database was taken from a web scraping I did of [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co), so it is mentioned here.

2 - This is a project for study purposes.

## Getting Started
Let's go !

### Prerequisites

To move forward and run this project I need you to have Docker installed, so here is the link to the official [website](https://www.docker.com).

If you are in a windows environment and don't have docker, I recommend this [tutorial](https://github.com/codeedu/wsl2-docker-quickstart) which is a github repository to help you.

### Installing

**Cloning the Repository**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Wesleyfbarretos/Pokedex-app

$ cd Pokedex-app
```

### Running

Now it's very simple, you just need to be in the application's root directory and run the following CLI command:

```bash
$ docker compose up
```
